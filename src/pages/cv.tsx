    <ul>
      <li>
        Creating a product people love
      </li>
      <li>
        Working for a highly ethical company
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in a JavaScript, Swift or Leadership role
      </li>
      <li>
        Either, visa sponsorship & relocation to the US, or full remote
