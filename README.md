  About Me
</h1>

My name is Rick, and I make things. I enjoy making apps, websites, companies, beer, wine, music, adventures happen, and my wife happy.

I am co-founder and CTO at [Nile](https://nile.ag), where our digital solutions aim to solve issues inherent to food trading including price discovery, quality verification, payments and traceability. Our current focus is on the Nile Marketplace, a B2B e-commerce platform that enables direct trades between producers and entities that sell to consumers.

I have spent all of my career as either a founder or an early employee at various startups, helping companies make products their customers love. Immediately preceding my time at Nile I helped take [Luno](https://luno.com) from series A funding to millions of customers and an eventual [acquisition by DCG](https://www.luno.com/blog/en/post/luno-joins-dcg).

Throughout the years I have tinkered primarily in JavaScript, Swift & Go, but have also dabbled in Ruby, Python, Kotlin, Java, & C.
